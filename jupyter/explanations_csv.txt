 "There seem to be multiple implementations of the DbAttribute class; which attribute is an instance of.  So it is difficult to trace the relevant methods.  It is possible; but an unsupported method exception for getName is also possible.  And the invocation of equals piggybacks on this doubt.  If getName is proper and returns a non-null string; which seems likely for any half-good DbAttribute class that actually has this method (o/w wed have an unsupported method); NPE shouldnt be a problem."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The version variable is tested in line 88; and is apparently not used in the setStart function.  So a null version should be tested for earlier; and should not cause problems here.

 There should be a check to see if currrentCommand.get() returns an empty list. If it returns an empty list; calling pop() on it should throw the NoSuchElementException.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It may be spinning indefinitely because nextOrdinal keeps returning the same value over and over instead of actually iterating; but there is no way to tell with this limited code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 When data.length is 2GB / 3; it is multiplied by 3 in the function which gives us a value higher than the maximum integer value for a signed int; so it overflows into a negative number. Hence the exception; because you are trying to create an array with a negative size.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The problem is one of the clocks getVersion is returning a negative value in line 248; however there is nothing about line 253 that could cause this. The problem is most likely the cast into a short in line 248 -- the init method for ClockEntry expects a long; which makes sense if they are a timestamp. If getVersion is returning a long it may be overflowing when casted into a short resulting in the negative number. Also; the exception on line 13 should be Long.MAX_VALUE; not Short.

 Since the copyOf method should be in the form "copyOf(boolean[] original;int newLength)" according to the java api; it seems like you have the correct format of code.  The api says the negative array size exception is thrown when the newLength variable is negative.  It could be possible that you are overloading the capacity of an int in java.

 The value of data.length is an integer. If so once you reach a certain value by calling the grow function in the while loop of the write function or if the data.length is at too high a value in the writeByte function; the sign on the integer flips and higher order bits are discarded.

 "I dont know the gerrit functions well enough to answer for sure on line 108.

 "One possible source of error would be that the 2GB file size limit stems from the maximum size for a 32-bit signed integer. If the data.length variable type is an integer more than a third of the maximum value and you multiply it by 3; then you will cause a problem with wrapping around to a negative. It would be better to divide by 2; then multiply by 3; but that still doesnt prevent a possible integer overflow from occurring. The solution is to check the size before the operation; or change the variable type."

 I think this could only happy if the data array is not initialized.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It null-checks every variable.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No null-checking.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Everything checks but it depends on the item class.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It adds the text correctly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I doubt you can use two functions in the same line (before a semicolon).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 NO_MORE_ORDINALS checks the ordinal variable.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The CopyOf function could grow to a size too large for the IDE to handle.

 Data is correct number

 It is wrong; because it is the wrong information.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There must be an exception within those lines; but where it lies isnt clear. Possibly in line 234 or 235."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 That looks fine.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Im not seeing anything that would cause it to return a negative value"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Always validate data before while looping over it. Or the memory might have been corrupted; thus the end value would not be NO_MORE_ORDINAL. It would be better to just stop when the iterator does not find another item.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It could be that there is an integer overflow; causing the value to become negative. Thus copying the array with a negative number would throw the exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Line 115 may be a problem depending on what the clear command on line 87 does. If it "nulls" out the comments; then line 115 could raise a null pointer exception. However; line 87 should be moved after line 90. This may be causing the Null Pointer exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont see anything wrong with line 77 - its just appending a space to a string."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Dont see any way for the getItems function call to produce an UnsupportedMethodException."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "A ClassCastException is thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance. I dont have enough information to know what the Section class is; but I suspect that the section.getTextClient() call cant be case to a Label."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I believe NoSuchElementException could be raised if there are no more commands in the command queue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Theres not enough information to tell where the error above is coming from. The declaration of calculateNumPopulatedBytes appears to be fine."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Arrays.copyOf raises a NegativeArraySizeException with the second parameter passed in is negative. 2GB/3 is too big of a number to be represented as a positive integer index in a Java Array.  I did the following simple check to test this:      int [] myIntArray  new int[2*1073741824/3] This test also received a java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The invocation of the clone function on line 253 is very straight forward. It does not appear to have anything to do with the ClockEntry constructor call on line 248 which is causing the exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The line seems unrelated to the error.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 getItems() is probably the culprit.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The specific line in question does not appear to be relevant to the error.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The code doesnt check whether a next element exists before getting it."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Not enough code shown.

 The problem may stem from 248.

 "This doesnt seem to be the problem. It looks to be setup correctly."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This seems to be declared correctly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In the declaration; it seems like "Section section" should read "String section" instead. By definition; the error is thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "It looks like endCurrentThreadExecutingCommand at line 87 is being used only once per thread. By definition; NoSuchElementException is thrown by the nextElement method of an Enumeration to indicate that there are no more elements in the enumeration.

 This should be fine. The NO_MORE_ORDINALS within the while statement should be keeping it from spinning indefinitely.

 The maximum value for an int is 2;147;483;647 (the data type of data.length).  An intermediate value in the calculation on line 122 exceeds this value; leading to a negative result.

 There is no information being sent to the function; you should be sending and also returning some data.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Should be specified as counter item before getting counts; the loop does not work as intended. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The mapScopeItem function conflicts with the getItems as referenced in the bottom code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Instead of .layout function; you should call .appendMessage on line 82 to avoid using wrong parameter.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The pop function throws that NoSuchElementException because it is written and not referenced in the code. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 That function is references; but requires a parameter that is not listed. In this case; the parameter should be include before calling that function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The copyOf function does not work in this case because it is not referenced before. It should invoke the grow array function.

 Not certain if a null item could cause this; but if item were null; the NPE would be raised in line 61.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Tracing this code back to Research Group for Industrial Software; there doesnt seem to be any possibility for this exception here.  (Im looking at https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/18037683/.)  getItems simply returns Collections.unmodifiableList for the given items; and unmodifiableList is definitely a supported method for Collections."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The invocation involves no casting; including in the boolean args.  So this error wouldnt appear.  Line 79; which contains an explicit cast; is a much better candidate."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This falls into the category of "return value is improperly used"; because popping from an empty queue/stack is a common cause of such an error.  With that said; I can only say "probably"; because I have little experience with threading; and I don\t know how this library works (and thus; how it returns queues/stacks).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Bug description doesn\t sound like something that would arise from simply returning the next ordinal in a list.  It seems like something that might arise from the loop; in particular.  Now; every time I\ve used iterators; I\ve had an explicit collection.  I suppose it is possible that this iterator implicitly involves a function that incorporates this "Probing algorithm".  So I can\t be entirely certain.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The length property is an int; so when this value is large; multiplication by 3 might cause overflow; resulting in a negative value.  (Division by 2 obviously does not fix this issue.)	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Casting an int to short can cause overflow; resulting in a negative value (like -532).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Int variables range from - to +. Is the array size rolling over from + to negative when the size gets to a certain point?	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Probably there might be an error i think.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 this program is not executable to cause null pointer exception

 It appears from the code that this function could very possibly cause unknown side effects in other areas of the code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I do not believe that there is anything wrong with this	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It appears that the body is not complete	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No I do not believe that there is 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In this case this would require some experimenting so see if there are issues with this	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The parameters are ambiguous 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The size appears to be unspecified	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No; nothing seems wrong in the declaration of the function; unless scope is not a global object and needs to be passed in as a parameter.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The code looks fine to me; the add is adding an item. Since the question pertains to mapScopeItem and not .add; mapScopeItem seems to be doing its job fine. For this exception might need to look at .add"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 A ClassCastException happens when an object is incorrectly cast to a function. But the function calls give the right type of class needed for the function. The only thing I can think of is maybe the getSection() needs a this. in front of them; or simply need to give the section object itself; since line 9 makes it seem the section object is available.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The NoSuchElementException is caused when there are no more elements in an enumeration. So if there is no current thread to end; then the exception will happen. This should be in a try catch block.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The parameters give a copy of the OrdinalIterator; but it appears that the iterator needs to go to the next Ordinal each time the function is called. this needs to happen in the parameter when calling the function; not in the function itself.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The negativearraysizeexception is called if a negative value is returned for length. data cant have a length smaller than 0; and thus the copyOf function probably cant give a value less than 0 from the math done."

 The datatype of data is not given. The value of the data is not initialized	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 After revising the information;  I can not determine what is the error for this function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In my opinion there is an error with the counter increment.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I personally believe that this conditional clause has several problems that need to be addressed.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In my opinion there is something wrong with the previous functions.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In my opinion there is an error with the command.

 If file version is null; for whatever reason; it is going to crash at line 87.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 String buffer is properly initialized. This is not going to cause problems.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 getItems is returning an unmodifiable list. If you call add on that list; it is generating the observed exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The ClassCastException is probably generated at line 79.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is no check that currentCommand.get() is returning a nonempty collection. The semantic of pop could cause the observed exception	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The problem seems related with nextOrdinal; but the body of that function is not visible.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Most probably data.length is a 32 bit integer; and when you are above 2 Gygabites you are going to go into overflow. So you are going into negative.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 From what I can see; the problem is related to getVersion. getVersion is returning a long; but you are then converting that to a short. Truncating a long to a short can cause problems.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I do not think the problem lies with the conditional clause between lines 110 and 112

 I can see where ordinals is defined; but not where ordinals is defined	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It would be helpful to see where else arrays are being defined within the body of the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Obviously the version being returned does not fall within the range of accepted values; I would look more closely at how v1 is being defined and what its value is at the same point in the code.

 Not all lists support adding. The functioncall getItems calls .unmodifiableList(items) suggesting that it is a list that cannot be modified and therefore does not support add	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The code looks very unsafe. But i cannot tell without seeing the getSection() method and what it returns.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Doesnt look like you checked for an empty command list beforehand	 	 	 	 	 	 
 not sure of the implementation of nextOrdinal(). likely returns something that is not 	 	  NO_MORE_ORDINALS. null?	 	 	 	 
 It is likely that data.length is big enough to cause "(data.length * 3) / 2" to be greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE creating a negative number there. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The bug likely lies in something else setting the clock versions; or that number overflowing. Either way the constructor should throw those exceptions to force the following code to do checks on the version numbers to see if they are valid. Or the set method on versions should only allow valid versions

 The NegativeArraySizeException is caused due to the second argument of copyof() method i.e. (data.length*3)/2 being negative. This might be due to data.length being a 32 bit integer and on increasing its size; the bug could be resolved.

 Not enough information is given about the value of the object currentCommand to determine if the pop is causing the issue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The function is set up to run properly. It should iterate and calculate the sum and end when it reaches the end of the iteration.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The value of data.length could exceed the maximum value stored in an integer. If the value becomes to high; the sign will flip and bits will be discarded. This causes the potential negative number. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No function declaration is fine. The issue is triggered from a ClockEntry constructor; which could possibly be line 248.

 I think that mapScope is improperly used here; try changing it around or reading some tutorials	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Need more context for this one; I cant tell"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I think that an improper function is being invoked	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It appears to be set up to keep calculating without an exit condition	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I think that it will work if you try changing it to this: this.data   Arrays.copyOf(data; (int)(((long)data.length * 3) / 2))   \n

 Function is declared properly but i think it needs correct parameters 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I think get() function cannot be used just before pop function. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes; it might because of OrdinalIterator exception. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I think its used at correct place to invoke particular method with its parameters "

 In my opinion there may not be any wrong regarding this. Grow is defined below that.  So it might be error less.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "It doesnt seem to be the problem."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Try using a different function with the convertscopetodescription to try and solve the issue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The issue seems to be caused there; maybe try using a different function.

 I would go through every single line checking for slight errors

 Must make sure that NO_MORE_ORDINALS is a real and static number; also must increment or decrement for while loop.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The array will be copied by data.length*1.5; so it will grow by half of the data originally.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Do a range check before so the exception will not be thrown.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it will never stop growing	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "NegativeArraySizeException is thrown when the second parameter of copyOf is negative (as you cant have a negative-sized array). If I had to guess; the index of the array reached its maximum and overflowed; due to the large size of the array (>2GB); leading it to wrap around to a negative number and thus making the second parameter of copyOf a negative value."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There are no issues with the invocation of the function setDescription in the function addComments."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The parameters are all correct.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I am unsure. It looks ok to me.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 In this piece of code \npublic void failed(IRepository parentObject; IReview modelObject; IStatus status) {      \n    AbstractReviewSection.appendMessage(getSection(); "Couldn\t load patch set: " + status.getMessage())  \n   }   \nthere are too many parameters trying to be passed to the appendMessage function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Everything looks fine.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The only issue I can see is that there is that the program does not know when there are no more ordinals; although it might be in other parts of the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The declaration looks to be fine.

 "Perhaps the value of version isnt null; but not what the program was expecting. This would cause the null check at line 88 to fail; but everything else would fail since the version was malformed. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Any time you try to get something out of a map you have to check for null since that key may not be mapped to anything. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It depends on if those functions use deprecated code. If they do the UnsupportedMethodException would throw.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 A Label object and whatever is returned by section.getTextClient() may not inherit from each other; thus casting them would not be possible.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If there was no value returned by get() then the pop() would not work since it is popping on an exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If that ordinal was not put into the list; then the following would run indefinitely. going until the iterator has no more elements would work better.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 An integer overflow is possible causing the value to become negative	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If that value was improperly inserted into the map by one of the clock values this could  happen.

 "not totally sure about that one. I know basic java. Im not THAT advanced yet"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 the boolean is correct; which mean that the comparasion is correct	 	 	 	 	 	 
 everything looks to be in order. It may need to be inside the () though	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it would just come up blank.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 get should be currentCommand	 	 	 	 	 	 
 everything LOOKS to be in order. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I think it would have infinite copies. I think I may be wrong though; not totally sure	 	 	 	 	 	 
 too many parentheses	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There should be a if(skipSet !	  null) check before calling skipset.add().

 If the column object somehow was null due to an issue with its instantiation; but we are guaranteed that label wont be null so it is not the source of the exception.

 "Cant think of a possible error case for this one."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Line 537 seems to have the issue; since objAttribute can be null at that point.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 should be: boolean changed   (comments.size() !\n	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If the file.getAbsoluteFilePath() returns null; and files does not permit null elements; it will throw an NPE. Likewise if it returns something that is not an FTPFile. Most likely the error is in line 78 though; trying to get the parent.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant tell if that line causes the problem without looking at the details of the GenericFileOperations and GenericFile classes."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant tell without knowing if attribute.getName() could possibly return null on line 542."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Return value of version.getComments() should be checked before invoking size()	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There doesnt seem to be anything wrong with line 80"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I really cannot tell on this one.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It looks fine to me.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "No; the function looks like it will perform its action as intended."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes; the variable is left blank causing the null pointer exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes; the function variable needs to be properly defined to prevent the null pointer exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 files needs to checked for null

 The variable "length" is not assigned anywhere else in the function after initial assignment of Long.MIN_VALUE.  This variable "length" is compared with undefined variable "minLength".  However to throw null pointer exception a method invocation should happen on null object.  I cannot see any line where this can potentially happen.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I just dont think there would be."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Not real sure.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 should be fttp files	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The conditional clause itself seems correctly written.  The function called to return the boolean operator does not return a null type.  The issue is probably in the size of list of FTPFiles called "files"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There are misplaced parenthesis followed by a boolean interruption on line 99.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The getName is not returning correctly below	  it is returning null below.	 	 	 	 	 
 creatUser should appear earlier in the sequence and causes the id to be null later on.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont think so; because the if statement is just using comparisons between variables; no functions are being called; so nulls should not throw an exception here."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Well there should be null checking in general; but the function parameter declarations should be fine.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Code is attempting to use null where an object is required.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Object is required; null is not acceptable.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Code cannot use null where an object must be used.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Cannot use null; getName should pull actual data. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 has unanticipated side effects	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Param values are not checked for before use.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The command that is given can be used and executed properly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The get command is put in the right place; and will execute what is needed to be done.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 needs to invoke a different function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 might have a misplaced parenthesis.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell without debugging it."

 " NullPointerException to be invoked at line 82 wouls mean that file.getFileNameOnly() returns null; but it souldnt happen"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "if both attribute and column have the propriety nam shouldnt throw a  NullPointerException"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Since I check that the comments is neither empty or null I shouldnt get a Null Pointer Exception when I do gerritComment.getLine()"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it makes the call to a null	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes; simply wrong	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It looks fine to me; might be a problem elsewhere	 	 	 	 	 	 
 maybe yes: should check if f is null before calling f.getName() maybe no: file (passed as argument of acquireExclusiveReadLock) may be null	 	 	 	 	 	 
 attribute may be null	 	 	 	 	 	 
 gerritComment is an element from comments. While we check whether comments is null or empty at line 88; we should also check whether gerritComment is null at line 97.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The invocation is correct	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong with the invocation of function "remove".	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong with the invocation of function "getLine".	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If one of the File objects does not have certain attributes; like name; timestamp; and the values are Null; then you will get this exception. So first need to add something like :\nif (f.getTimeStamp() !  null) {\n \n} \n	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont see how this code could generate a NullPointer Exception"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 You should add code to review that getRanges() does not return a null value. If it does; skip the rest of the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "min_length isnt defined"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 should be at a different place in the code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "i dont think there is a problem with this part"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 looks acceptable i believe	 	 	 	 	 	 
 wrong order	 	 	 	 	 	 
 hard to tell	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The NPE is most probably being caused before that; e.g line 83 could be a place where the NPE occurs because the List of files has a null element in them.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 CreateComment MUST be returning null due to some corner condition. Please provide code for createComment.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If file is not null; the method will work well	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I need more information to take my decision.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 gerritComment is not changed; so it would be the same if change the place.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I assume that there is because it states program execution causes NullPointerException	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The invocation of equals() seems well formed; and if the invocations of getName() and getFileNameOnly() do not return what is expected because of what they are passed; the comparison should just end up false.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I just cant tell."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I believe there is a wrong counter increment	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Correct	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Should be at a different place in the code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Because of the for-loop	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Wrong invocation	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Because of line 05	 	 	 	 	 	 
 if the file name returned by the getFileNameOnly() is null; you might get the exception	 	 	 	 	 	 
 if attributeOverrides 	  new HashMap<ObjAttribute	 ColumnDescriptor>()	  return null	 one could get the NullPointerException	 	 
 It can happen that List<FTPFile> files are initialised null and dont get updated in the if-else. Its better to put a null check before accessing the name of the file	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This looks fine	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This needs more symbols	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "doesnt say what ExlcusiveReadLockStrategy is inside the function call"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "dont check for null values throughout code before using objects"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 looks alright. not sure. if clause looks correct.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 probably should not say clear	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I don\t believe the program understands the "Millis" term; possibly change it to a recognizable time (i.e.-seconds; minutes; hours)	 	 	 	 	 	 
 return statement is at the wrong place	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It seems like if you can\t find a file version then "version" would be a null value. That would give you a NullPointerException when you try to run .getComments().	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Those lines seem correct.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It is just simple	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is no instantiation of files. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 String alias;\n getCurrentAlias()++;\n if (skipSet.add(new ColumnTracker(alias; attribute))) {	 	 	 	 	 	 
 You have done a lot of null check but the variable DbAttribute attribute in line 519  is not null-checked. That could be the cause.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 all are coded correct	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell  "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 May not serve the purpose of the code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There isnt any point in execution where line 84 would execute if there was a null file. Perhaps the file it is reading has a corrupted header?"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I am not sure if the selected lines will ever actually execute.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Your are trying to acquire a value that is being referenced by a pointer type.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it is exactly correct.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 To much happening; would need a debugging tool.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant see full code."

 No error between line 69 and 73.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Need to see full definition of ReviewScope to debug.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Most likely getParent() returns a class that does not have layout() method.  Cannot tell from given code section.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Call to get() should be surrounded by checks such as if (hasMoreElements()) { }

 I cant tell this	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont think this kind of method calling is possible in java"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I am not sure if such method invoking exists in Java	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This is a short hand assignment; perfectly used	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Exception Handling was not included in the function; including the try catch block will help us in knowing the exact error	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I have no idea about this; need to Google this and understand	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It seems correct to me	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Should be at a different place in code 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Return statement is at the wrong place 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Wrong variables	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Different parameters needed	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Not computing expected results	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It seems that something is missing 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Im not sure "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I am not sure what is causing that issue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The function is throwing a ClassCastException because in the appendMessage function; on line 79; is attempting to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance. Might want to try turning the Label into a string; and then setting the labels text property."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "This exception is thrown to indicate that there are no more elements in the enumeration; or stack. Before calling the currentCommand.get().pop(); its best to check if their is an element to pop.

 The while loop is never going to break; or end. It is an infinite loop; and you will run out of memory before it ever finishes. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Your array can not exceed 2GB in length; this is the array size limit imposed by Java. It means your (data.length * 3) / 2) equals about 3GB; which might overflow the size of int; causing the index of the array to become negative.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The range is out of scope. It must be between 1 and 32767; and you are passing in -532. Insert a statement to check for correct values between 1 and 32767.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 broken code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 code error	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The call to get() is fine; since earlier the same call is made when setting count. The error likely lies with the .item attribute being null which causes the null pointer exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The type of the getItems function is an unmodifiable list meaning that calling the add function on it would clearly be an ACL violation. Therefore the type doesnt even have the add function Im assuming which causes the unsupported method exception. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The conditional looks completely fine and doesnt do anything that would cause a ClassCastException."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The pop() function is usually called on some sort of enumeration; and if the enumeration has no more elements then you will get this error. There should be a check to make sure that the end of the queue/stack/whatever hasnt been reached. Not knowing the type that get() returns makes proper debugging difficult."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 As long as we can be sure nextOrdinal() will eventually return the value NO_MORE_ORDINALS then the while loop is fine.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The .length property of an array I believe is of type int. When you take this int value and multiply by 3 it could overflow the max_value of an integer. This will cause the value to jump to the far negative which would cause a negative array size exception. This is likely when the value of the arrays length is very large."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The for loop is not the issue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Doesnt need a parameter not listed."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There should be no problems calling private methods from the own class. No external classes are able to call a private method.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont see any reason why setText would be wrong. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 there needs to be a check to see if there is an element to pop before popping. There needs to be something to handle NoSuchelementexceptions if this exception occurs.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There is nothing I see wrong with the invocation of function calculateVIntSize."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Doesn\t need any parameters not listed if the method "grow" is within the current class with the array "data".

 Unclear which version of the get() function is being called.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Looks good.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If buf.length() happens to be more than (data.length * 3) / 2; this function will fail.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 An exception might be thrown; but not because of the iteration code on line #265. The likely error is further down the chain.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I would say your issue would have to do with line 79; the cast to Label; or line 81; the implicit cast of "message" to string. However; without additional knowledge of the Section method; or the getSection() method; I can\t tell.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I don\t know anything about Hystrix. I wouldn\t think that the "pop" would be incorrect; probably the "get"; but there are so many overridden methods below that there\s no way to tell in which one the error lies.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 copyOf uses an int for newLength; and the max size for an int is 2GB. 2GB/3*3	 2GB so it will fail. You should try to use a function that does not use an "int" value. I do not know what function that would be.	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant tell if the scope object has been correctly instantiated at that point."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "getItems returns an unmodifiable view which shouldnt support the add method."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The exception is most likely caused by the casting of the result of section.getTextClient to object Label.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Nothing wrong with the declaration.  There should be better error checking on currentCommand.get().	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There doesnt appear to be anything unusual about the function invocation.  Perhaps the nextOrdinal function needs to be checked to ensure its return values match what is being checked in the loop condition."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The declaration is not the problem.  The problem is due to the limitation of integer arithmetic.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The for loop initialization; increment and exit condition appear ok.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Seems to be formatted properly	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Most likely needs different parameters to produce the correct result	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The parenthesis are misplaced. The exclamation mark should not be within them.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Definitely should be in a different place in the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The plus sign next to the equal sign could be the problem	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It seems as though the wrong variables have been used as parameters and that there are missing and the wrong type of parameters and they are in the wrong order. I could be wrong; I am only a novice.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Everything seems fine	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes; the function needs to be correctly defined and there is misplaced parentheses.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No; the function looks like it retrieves the information correctly. The side effect is minimal and result of the surrounding code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The function variables may not be properly defined in the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "No; the invocation looks like its properly implemented in the code and wont have any side effects."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The while-loop looks like its producing as intended and does exit when expected."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The function could use different variables that would have different parameters to limit them.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The size could merge differently and not function correctly if the variable is too large.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont see any way that line could cause that error."

 It is hitting a problem with Arrays.copyOf taking an integer as the new length of the array; the max size of an int coincides with the 2gb of data; so the int wraps around to the negative side.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The boolean operator is right.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell  "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The map seems to be empty. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell  "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The object data does not exist in the grow function	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong in the code snippet between lines 80 and 83.  This code would execute fine if the passed object "section" is well populated in the rest of the code.  If "section" parameter to appendMessage variable is not correctly set to a "Label" object; then the typecasting to Label object on line 79 would cause ClassCastException.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I do not see any error with the way the code is written.  Both the lines where grow() method is invoked look fine with no issues as such.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing inside the ()

 "Its unclear what NLS.bind actually does or what it returns.  I would tend to think that the issue is with NLS.bind unless the implied concatenation of strings in line 82 is the culprit. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If .pop() returns a nosuchelement exception it is likely that the flaw is in currentCommand.get() and unfortunately the source code simply is not provided	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If the while loop is set to run while ordinal !	  some constant value	 I can only conclude that NO_MORE_ORDINALS is never being reached	 	 	 	 
 "If the code is returning a negative array size exception at that size; this suggests that data.length is exceeding the maximum size for an integer primitive type.  Predictably; this is occurring at 2 GB / 3 which is the mathematical reciprocal of 3/2 in line 121.  By default; the int data type is a 32-bit signed twos complement integer which explains why your code is getting the negative array size.  The int value has overflowed."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Not familiar with vector clocks; however the value supplied to the constructor should be between 1 and 32767.  The fact that a -532 is supplied; suggests that the code has incremented the value in question past 32767 at some point	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The code appears to be working correctly in the lower examples; the convertScopeToDescription seems to be right.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The for loops do not contain any counter increments.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There are misplaced parenthesis with no data in them at the end of the line.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The code appears after the errors occur.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The code appears to be written correctly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I think that maybe it should be (data.length * 2) / 3) instead of (data.lenth *3) / 2).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The versions are not correctly listed in the source code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Well there is no null checking on the gerritComment not being null.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The entrySet function could return a null or the counts variable could be null (less likely since it is used above).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Well there is no checking on the scope to see if it has a value or that it actually implements the function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "A section type has a getTextClient function which the result is being cast as a label; however I dont know what the real return type is; so it is very likely that when isDisposed() is called; the function is trying to cast the type and throwing the exception."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Probably; because the element is probably being enumerated but there is no next element or this element doesnt exist."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell if the calculateVIntSize function is working correctly; as it is doing some byte math to get the ones that are being used; but I think the nextOrdinal should still run out of ordinals."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Well the copyOf function is being sent the length of the array; which even if the arrays length is 0; this shouldnt throw the negative exception since it wont be negative.  It could be related to an int overflow that is not handled in the library code since such large values are being dealt with."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The version could possibly be negative which is being passed to Math.max; which just receives two getVersions; and we dont know that these are positives."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "It appears variable type isnt assigned."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 if the growth size; i.e. (data.length*3)/2; is less than size of b it can make problem.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it seems there is something wrong	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I would need more information.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Code is such that it is using null when an object is required.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Object required; cant be null."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Examine the particulars of the scope and scope2.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Code is attempting to cast an object to a subclass where its not an instance of the subclass."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Indicates the end of a list has been reached and no more elements are available.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Code is caught in a repetitive pattern. Use different specifics.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There are evidently limits to the length of array possibilities.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Appears that an entry is outside of the stated range.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 When an object is needed; the result of null is not acceptable.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Cannot use null value. Be sure an object is available to convert to description.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Unclear as to how this would cause the error.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Code tries to cast an object to a subclass where it doesnt belong."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Usually indicates there are no more elements in the list.

 The command given is used properly and will execute what is needed to be done.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It may need different parameters in order for it to work properly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The command used in the code is used properly and will work right.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The get command should be used at the beginning of the line	  for example	 instead of currentCommand.get	 it should be get.currentCommand.	 	 	 
 The lines of code are used properly and will execute what it is supposed to do.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The number arrangement in line 121 is not in the proper order.  When putting in the numbers; they must be in order.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The get command is supposed to be at the beginning of the command; so that it reads get.this.versions.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I thing it requires a missing parameter.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The return value may be incorrect.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it needs to invoke a different function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "It may require a  parameter that isnt listed."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont think that there is a problem with this code."

 "line 82 shoudnt cause a ClassCastException; probably more at line 79 could be caused"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 probably the error is due to the fact that I do the pop without checking if I have a stack for doing the get	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Its not the common way to use the itarator; we could use ordinal.hasNext()"

 I think you are using the function incorrectly

 Im not quite sure with this one	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Might be using the wrong function; there are better options	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The appropriate values are there; so there does not seem like it should produce something wrong when called.

 "scope2.getItems returns an unmodifiable list. So we cant add to that list. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 getParent may not return an object with a method .layout()	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I would like to know the values that currentCommand takes.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it could be that NO_MORE_ORDINALS is never returned by nextOrdinal(). Or the error could be in calculateVIntSize	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it could be that one or both of v1 or v2 has a version above 32767; and when cast to short; it overflows. I think casting to short and then taking the max may fix the bug (instead of taking the max and then casting).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The loop is correct.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong with the invocation of the function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong in the declaration of the function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong with the invocation of the function.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There is nothing wrong with the invocation of function calculateVIntSize."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The new size value  "(data.length * 3) / 2" probably is too large. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is nothing wrong with the invocation of the function size.\nIn line 248 "max(v1.getVersion(); v2.getVersion())" probably returns a negative value.      	 	 	 	 	 	 
 That boolean only determines whether the SB StringBuilder should have a comma appended.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Some where; it must be sending an instance of ReviewScope that does not have the getItems() method. So the code should check the instance type (typeof) of the intance; and only getItems if it is supported.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 You should add code to ensure that Section is indeed a Label. You have to check that getSection() does return an object that is of type Label.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "The code is incorrectly assuming that there will be an element in the currentCommand to Pop. You cant assume that and should add code to first verify the current command has something to get; and; that it can be popped."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The while should be :  while (ordinal > 0 && ordinal < NO_MORE_ORDINALS)\n	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The issue is that the length parameter is larger than the max value of the 2nd CopyOf of parameter. So once it overflows; it heads into negative territory. Check the max value that it can have and add code to handle it and throw a proper message; or to hand this copy in a different way.

 "Youre missing implementation of the method add."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The actual issue is with line 79; where you are trying to cast section.getTextClient which might not stick to the interface expected by textClientLabel. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Need more information regarding what currentCommand is; there is certainly some issue with using .get() chained with .pop	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Code missing! Please check the value of NO_MORE_ORDINALS and confirm that nextOrdinal returns NO_MORE_ORDINALS.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 All of this is in-memory; hence what is happening is that the RAM is overflowing at some point of time there.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 At some point of time; the version of the node was changed to be greater than 32767. the code related to returning version should not assume Java will autobox the variable. Another big issue which is causing fuziness in debugging is the fact that when "creating a new node" the version can go above the 32767 value; as the only check done is for <0. So if the created a precondition for checks; it would help you get the exact object that has a version > 32767; thereby working around the "negative" values.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Since the code compiles; there is no problem with the method signature.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is no difference in changing the places. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If getTextClient() returns String; the cast cannot be done	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The thread was initialized and is running. So probably the problem is in another place.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I should have more details; because I dont know if ordinals.iterator() returns a OrdinalIterator"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Considering that data is an Array and it is also not null; there is no problem.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Probably the problem is in another part of the code; maybe in the place where the versions are initialized 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It states Program execution causes ClassCastException; which leads me to believe that there is an issue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It does not produce any of those messages.

 I would assume this; because of the data.length * 3) /2)	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There does not appear to be a problem with this line.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It seems okay to me.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Why should it be there? The invocation seems in order; as long as PatchLineComment has a getWrittenOn method	  even if it returned a null pointer	 presumably setCreationDate can assign null to a date value.	 	 	 	 
 No	 " if there are none	 the for loop should simply exit	 as the initial value of item will exceed null if it happens to be returned."	 	 	 
 It looks fine.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Im not sure I see any casting done there. However; textClientLabel is cast from the result of the method section.getTextClient(); so perhaps the exception is thrown between lines 80 and 83 because textClientLabel was not successfully cast earlier?"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The pop is not subordinated to the object in the appropriate way. Need parens?	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The body of the while loop seems to be in order; but whether or not it ever ends depends on nextOrdinal (and how it behaves when given its data in the case in question). If the ordinals in question can be iterated over successfully; and nextOrdinal sets NO_MORE_ORDINALS appropriately once there are no more ordinals in the given OrdinalSet; then this particular while loop should not be the problem (a debugger or a test output would be helpful to pinpoint the problem).	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If the exception is thrown for data larger than 2GB / 3; that suggests that for such data; three times the data length divided by two exceeds the allowable range of values for the second parameter to copyOf; perhaps because of a typing problem; so that the result of the arithmetical operation is no longer a real number greater than or equal to 1.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 i is a loop variable initialized to 0	 " it is only ever incremented within the while loop and stops being incremented if either it or its counterpart comes to equal the size of the two clocks	 which will presumably be in the range (1	 32767).

 "it doesnt have the storage capacity."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The code is trying to add to a list of unmodifiable items. The add method is probably not supported.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There may be no elements left to pop at that point in the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 NO_MORE_ORDINALS might be set to a value lower than the original ordinal; therefore the ordinal will never equal it and therefore will never break from the loop.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Pointer values can be decimal. So I think probably there are no issues with the code.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "There may be times when you want to pass a Collection or Map to another class but you want to insure that the object you pass is not changed. You can do this by passing an unmodifiable Collection or Map. The Collections class provides methods to create an unmodifiable view of a Collection or Map. This view is not a copy of the original object but simply passes through all methods that dont change the contents of the object. All other methods will throw an UnsupportedMethodException. This limitation is true for the object itself; any iterators created from the object; as well as any Collections created (in the case of a Map). Here are the methods to create unmodifiable objects:\n\nCollection unmodifiableCollection(Collection c)\nList unmodifiableList(List l)\nMap unmodifiableMap(Map m)\nSet unmodifiableSet(Set s)\nSortedMap unmodifiableSortedMap(SortedMap s)\nSortedSet unmodifiableSortedSet(SortedSet s)"

 It looks like there is an overflow issue. When you add; the added value might be out of the range of the previous definition. For example; if the added value is mathematically larger than 32767 then an overflow will occur and the value might be negative as shown in the error msg. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Wrong code at the wrong place. In line 24; you are taking an unmodifiable list and then in line 235 you are trying to add an item to it. You can add to an unmodifiable list. Either remove the unmodifiable restriction or just read the list without writing anything.

 The getItems() in line 23 returns a unmodifiable list and so you cannot add anything to the list. Use it as read-only. Or if you really want to add; just return it in line 24 without making it unmodifiable.

 getTextClient may return any object which is of a subclass of the "Control" class; not just a Label object. So; this error is caused when getTextClient returns an object other than a label; which is then attempted to be cast to a Label object.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Im sorry; Ive spent an hour on this task; and dont have any more time to spend."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Looks like the second parameter of copyOf is evaluating to a negative number. The Array.length variable is stored as an int; which has a maximum value of 2;147;483;647. If it is increased above that; it will overflow and the result will be a negative number. So when data.length is greater than 715;827;882; then data.length * 3 will overflow and produce a negative; which then gets divided by 2 and passed in to the copyOf method; generating this error.

 It looks ok to me; could form an error message possibly. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The function is producing a correct return value. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell from this code. "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 The return value is correct and is in the correct place. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 function written incorrectly.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 the data length can become a non-integer	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No clue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No clue.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I THINK ITS IN THE RIGHT PLACE & DOES THE RIGHT WORK OF ADDING THE ITEMS AFTER GETTING IT	 	 	 	 	 	 
 BUT THERE IS NO declaration & definition for getparent()method	 	 	 	 	 	 
 YES; POP FUNCTION MIGHT BE PLACED IN A SEPARATE LINE AT THE NEXT STEP OR SOME OTHER PLACE IN THE METHOD	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant see full code."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Not thread safe.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No error	 	 	 	 	 	 
 There is no error	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Error in that line	 	 	 	 	 	 
 no	 	 	 	 	 	 
 idk	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I only have a basic understanding of Java; and Im not familiar with the below code."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it probabaly not	 	 	 	 	 	 
 i cant guess	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it will be yes	 	 	 	 	 	 
 This different function has unanticipated side effects	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Yes because there should be a variable inside the parameters of grow. 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 I see no errors	 	 	 	 	 	 
 If there is a NegativeArraySizeException for data larger than 2GB/3; then perhaps you should always check if data.length is positive first; before calling the function grow(). Putting in an error check before calling this function will avoid this exception.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it looks correct	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 at 80th line "!" symbol is present inside bracket so when we execute it it will give exceptional error	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant tell"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 getItems() function is not given in the source code	 	 	 	 	 	 
 It should be working correctly if nextOrdinal() is implemented correctly (not shown in the source code)	 	 	 	 	 	 
 No Such Element implies that currentCommand is out of scope.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I dont know where the bug is. Are you confirming that calculateVIntSize is returning valid data? "	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "If data.length * 3 /2 results in a data value too high; which overruns on a signed data type; it will flip the left-most bit and become negative. Is this defined as an unsigned type? Is it large enough type to hold the result?\nI dont think this is at all related; but where/how is data scoped? You arent passing data into any of the three functions shown; so it seems to be scoped global or at least global to this code. Is that an issue?    \n\n"	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "Cant tell; the only issues that there might be on that specific line are if the second parameter is not of type int. However; since that probably isnt the issue; see if anything is returning a -1 when you are to access the size of the array."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 it looks good to me	 	 	 	 	 	 
 "I cant see where it is supposed to be."	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Correct parameters. Could be related to database query not supporting method.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 Should check if currentCommand.get() has any elements before attempting to pop.
