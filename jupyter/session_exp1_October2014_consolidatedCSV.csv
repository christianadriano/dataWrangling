If the data.length variable type is an integer more than a third of the maximum value and you multiply it by 3; then you will cause a problem with wrapping around to a negative. It would be better to divide by 2; then multiply by 3; but that still doesn't prevent a possible integer overflow from occurring. The solution is to check the size before the operation; or change the variable type.,,,,,,,x,,,

The problem is most likely the cast into a short in line 248 -- the init method for ClockEntry expects a long; which makes sense if they are a timestamp.
